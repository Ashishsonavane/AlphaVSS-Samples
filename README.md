This repository contains sample projects for the [AlphaVSS](https://github.com/alphaleonis/AlphaVSS) library.

## AlphaShadow

This project is an adoption of the official C++ [VShadow Tool Sample](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/vss/vshadow-tool-and-sample) from Microsoft to 
.NET and AlphaVSS.  It  is a command-line tool that you can use to create and manage volume shadow copies.  Run `AlphaShadow help` for more informtion.

## VssBackup

This is a project containing a couple of examples combining [AlphaFS](https://github.com/alphaleonis/AlphaVSS) and [AlphaVSS](https://github.com/alphaleonis/AlphaVSS).

## SnapshotQuery

This is a very simple example just illustrating how to start with AlphaVSS.
